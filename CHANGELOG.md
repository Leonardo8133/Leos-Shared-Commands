# Changelog

All notable changes to the Task and Documentation Hub extension will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Drag-and-drop support for reorganising folders and commands directly inside the
  Task and Documentation Hub command tree view.
- Status bar enhancements with a hoverable command menu and support for pinning
  frequently used commands as dedicated status bar shortcuts.
- Dedicated **Test Runner** side panel with configuration webview, inline test actions,
  and automatic code lenses next to discovered tests.

### Changed
- The default status bar shortcut now displays the full command hierarchy on
  hover instead of opening a quick pick list.

### Deprecated
- Nothing yet

### Removed
- Manual "keep terminal open" and "clear before running" options from the command
  editors. Terminals now always stay open and output is preserved between runs.

### Fixed
- Improved command execution reliability for external Command Prompt and
  PowerShell sessions.
- Dedicated VS Code terminals no longer depend on optional terminal names to
  persist between runs and automatically generate unique names when collisions occur.

### Security
- Nothing yet
